### The Project has 2 main hypotesis:

**Hypothesis 1**: Multivariate methods generate biological relationship between the molecules and construct networks among them. (sRCCA and sPLS)

**Hypothesis 2**: Machine-learning generate GEBV using functional genomics.(Bayesian Network, Artificial Neural Network, support vector machine, kernel matrix transformation, etc)
